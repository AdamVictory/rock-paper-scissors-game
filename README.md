# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game - Project 2

<img src="https://github.com/AdamVictory/rock-paper-scissors-game/blob/main/wireframescreenshots/responsive.png">

This website consists of a modern and user friendly rock paper scissors game that allows the individual to compete against the computer. It is a fun game that can be played by anyone and has a truly random result creating a fair game. This website will allow the user to understand the rules of the game and learn more about probability and improve their decision making. It is very easy to use so it can be played by all ages.  

The main aim of this project is to contruct an aesthetically pleasing, easy to use, responsive and modern website which substantially creates a fun experience for the user by allowing them to interact further with the website. It will be constructed using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The full list of technologies used can be found further down.

# User Experience
## Purpose 

The main goal for this website is to serve as an easy to use online game for users to compete against a computer in rock paper scissors. It provides all the key infomation on how to play the game and takes a new modern approach to the game including emojis instead of hand signs which has been done before. It is also easy to use for new users who have never played the game before and it a unique game for those who have played the game before but maybe not online, against a computer or through using emojis.

## First Time Visitor Goals
+ As a first time user, I can easily learn how to play the game and click on the emojis to compete against the computer. 

## Returning Visitor Goals
+ As a returning user, I can improve upon my score and beat the computer by a higher score.

## Frequent Visitor Goals
+ I can play together with friends on the same screen to beat the computer together.

# Features 

### Existing Features

+ The Header - This section consists of the title of the game which is called Rock Paper Scissors Game. The font is big so it's clear what game the user is playing. The heading also consists of a playful question which asks if the user can beat the computer, I changed the colour of this text to create contrast and allow the question to stand out so it's clear the game can only be played against a computer.

+ The Game - This section consists of the game options which involve three different emojis of a rock, paper and scissors to express the three different options. I feel that using these emojis are better than hand signals as younger people may not know what they represent. This section also consits of a scoreboard to easily allow the user to view if they won the hand or not. It lowers the opacity of the emoji if the user lost or drew the game and does not lower the opacity if they win that hand. I changed the colour of the numbers to create contrast and easily allow the user to know the score.

+ The Footer - This section appears on the bottom of the page. It clearly tells the user how to play the game. I didn't want to make it abolsute at the botton as I like how it moves down as the player plays more.

## Features Left to Implement

+ If I had more time I would have added more animations to the game to make it even more of an experience. I would also add a thank you for this playing image.

# Testing

## Cross-Browser Testing 
I tested the website across 3 web browsers that are Mozilla Firefox, Google chrome and Safari. The site worked on all of these web broswers. 
I tested the website, it is responsive and functions well using Google Dev Tools on all device sizes. 


## Compatibility Testing 
I tested on many different devices such as Apple Macbook pro, Dell laptop, Apple Ipad, Samsung Galaxy phone. No major issues were found. All of the text is readable, understandable and has good contrast. 


## Responsiveness Testing 
I used Google Chromes developer tools to test the responsiveness of the website throughout development. I designed the website for different screen sizes such as 800px (medium screen size), 600px (small screen size) annd 400px (ultra small screen size). 

## User Testing 
All information was presented clearly with contrasting backgrounds. 
The simplicity of the website makes it very easy to view and navigate through. 
The opacity changes in the emojis is very clear as well and shows who the winner is. 
The colours chosen make it very easy to navigate through the webiste. 
I confirmed that the game results are always correct. 

## Validator Testing 

+ HTML
- No errors were found when using the the offical W3C validator.

### Issues and Resolutions

+ I did not run into any issues while creating this project. 



## Deployment

+ The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - Used the Code Institutes Template 
  - Named my github repository
  - Installed Gitpod google chrome extension 
  - Began to push changes to my GitHub repository
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
